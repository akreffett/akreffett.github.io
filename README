This is a collection of YUM repositories for for installing the Collective
Intelligence Framework (CIF) via RPM instead of manual tarball/CPAN module
installation.

The included repositories are:

* /repos/cif-v1 	- CIF version 1.x releases and dependencies
* /repos/cif-v1-testing	- CIF version 1.x testing releases

*** Important ***
These repositories contain RPMs that will upgrade some RPMs from the version
shipped on standard platforms (RHEL/CentOS/etc) from either the base or EPEL
repositories.  Beware that while these updated packages are not known to 
conflict with other packages there is a chance that conflicts may arise in
the future.  As such it is recommended that these packages only be used on
dedicated hardware of VMs
*** Important ***

Under each repository are platform- and architecture-specific directories
following this pattern:

{platform}/{arch}

Where platform is currently only el6 and arch is one of SRPMS for source RPMs,
i386 and x86_64 for 32-bit and 64-bit ISA, respecively.

For example the RHEL 6 64-bit release repository is located at:

* http://akreffett.github.io/repos/cif-v1/el6/x86_64

The cif-v1 repository for each platform/architecture contains a copy of the
cif-v1-release RPM that can be installed which will install the YUM repositories
and GPG keys for both of the normal and testing repositories.  It can be found at:

http://akreffett.github.io/repos/cif-v1/el6/{arch}/Packages/cif-v1-release-1-1.noarch.rpm
